# Contract Redliner

This is a prototype web application that allows contract administrators to upload client contracts and compare them against a knowledge base using an AI model. The UI is built with Google's Material 3 web components.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (if desired):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The `knowledge_base` directory contains example contracts for the AI to reference. Uploaded client contracts are stored in the `uploads` directory.
